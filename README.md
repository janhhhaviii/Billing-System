Restaurant Billing System using c programming language
A Restaurant billing system created using the C programming language,I had designed a program that allows the restaurant staff to generate invoice, calculate 
the total bill, apply any discounts or taxes, and generate a final receipt for the customer,check all invoices generated,search invoice 

Here's a basic outline of how the program could work:
1. **Generate Invoice**:This program will will take input from user like name of customer,no of items orderd,price of each items , quantity of each item,name of item.

2. **Calculation**: The program will then calculate the subtotal by multiplying the quantity of each item by its price. It can also calculate any applicable taxes or discounts based on predetermined rules.

3. **Total Bill**: After calculating all the costs, the program will sum up the subtotal, taxes, and discounts to get the total bill amount.

4. **Receipt Generation**: Finally, the program can generate a receipt that includes the itemized list of orders, along with their prices, the subtotal, any taxes or discounts applied, and the final total amount to be paid by the customer.

In C programming, I have had used variables to store item numbers,name, quantities, prices, and totals. Loops can help in iterating through the menu items and calculating the bill. Conditional statements can be used to apply discounts or taxes based on certain conditions.

This system can be further enhanced by adding features like handling multiple tables, storing order history. The flexibility of C programming allows for the creation of a robust and efficient restaurant billing system.
